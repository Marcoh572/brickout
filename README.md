# brickout
My personal rendition of the classic game Brickout, created as a Java Swing Application. This game utilizes many aspects of the Java Swing Libraries, as well as Object Oriented Programming, to create a seamless, enjoyable experience with many customizable features. Basically it's just a lot of fun ðŸ˜Š
